            { question: "23. What is a 'Read Model' sticky note?", answer: "A square <b>green</b> sticky note that represents the data a user needs to make a decision." },

            { question: "30. What is the outcome of a successful Big Picture session?", answer: "A shared understanding of the domain, and a prioritized list of problems and opportunities to address." },
            { question: "31. What is a 'Policy' in Event Storming?", answer: "A purple sticky note that represents a rule or a policy that triggers an action in response to an event." },
            { question: "32. Why is the timeline critical in Event Storming?", answer: "It enforces a shared understanding of the sequence of events and reveals causality." },
            { question: "33. How does Event Storming build alignment?", answer: "By bringing people from different departments together to create a visual, shared understanding of the process." },

            { question: "37. What is the most important benefit of Event Storming for a team?", answer: "It creates a shared understanding of a complex domain, which leads to better communication and faster, more effective problem-solving." },
            { question: "38. Why is a timebox important for 'Chaotic Exploration'?", answer: "It keeps the session moving and prevents getting stuck on minor details at the beginning." },
            { question: "39. What pattern signifies a decision point?", answer: "An Event leading to multiple possible Commands or Policies." },
            { question: "40. What pattern signifies a feedback loop?", answer: "A chain of events that eventually loops back to trigger a previous event or a similar process." },
            { question: "41. What does a lack of a clear timeline indicate?", answer: "That the group has a poor shared understanding of the process flow." },
            { question: "42. What does a cluster of red sticky notes often indicate?", answer: "A major area of concern or a 'hotspot' in the business domain that needs immediate attention." },
            { question: "43. How can you identify a 'bounded context' on the board?", answer: "A bounded context often appears as a cluster of related Domain Events, Commands, and Aggregates." },
            { question: "44. What is a 'Command-Event' relationship?", answer: "A <b>Command</b> (action) causes a <b>Domain Event</b> (result)." },
            { question: "45. Why is it important to have diverse participants?", answer: "To get a holistic view of the domain from different perspectives, avoiding blind spots." },
            { question: "46. What is the 'narrative' of an Event Storm?", answer: "The story of how the business process unfolds, as told by the sticky notes on the wall." },
            { question: "47. What is the biggest mistake a facilitator can make?", answer: "Forcing a specific solution or outcome instead of allowing for free, collaborative exploration." },
            { question: "48. What's the difference between a 'Hotspot' and an 'Opportunity'?", answer: "A Hotspot is a known problem without a clear solution, while an Opportunity is an idea with a clear path forward." },
            { question: "49. What does the 'Big Picture' aim to solve?", answer: "Alignment problems and a lack of shared understanding among stakeholders." },
            { question: "50. How are Aggregates represented?", answer: "Aggregates are represented as <b>yellow</b> stickies placed on top of a <b>pink</b> system sticky, showing the aggregate inside that system." }
